# COVID-19 Statistics

This is going to be a web page with statistics of COVID-19 worldwide. It's a monolithic app developed using TDD in a new language (Python).

I've divided the entire development into phases:

1. The MVP
2. The data
3. The consolidation

Phases are driven by delivery, so with each phase, there will be breaking changes, and everything has to be documented.

## Main Technologies

- ReactJS with Vite
- TypeScript
- Python
