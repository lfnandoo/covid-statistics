# The Data

In this phase, the primary objective is to store all the required data in a database (DB). This will enhance the performance of the application, as we will no longer rely on an external API to fetch data, and it will expand the possibilities for statistics development in the next phase.

## Data requirements

- Data should be persistently stored in a flat SQL schema, which will need to be designed.
- The frontend should continue to function as it is, but with improved performance since we will have control over the data.
